## Desktop Application Development using Python

Good day! I would like to talk about how I used Python programming language to develop great desktop application. However, before I talk about the development process, I wanted to talk about why Python is a great tool to employ.

### Why Python?

Python is a very popular programming language and is used for software development, data analysis and scientific research. However, its popularity doesn't only stem from its widespread applicability but also from its very close affinity to English language. If you are still pondering over why Python should be learned then you can check [Medium](https://medium.com/@mindfiresolutions.usa/python-7-important-reasons-why-you-should-use-python-5801a98a0d0b). 

### Guided User Interface

Python is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language and thus efforts are concentrated around objects that represent real world objects. In order to develop desktop application, we should use aframework that can objectify front-end of our application. There are many GUI frameworks for Python but I chose to work on [PyQT](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro).
